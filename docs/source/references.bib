  abstract  = {Abstract A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse ({GI}) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The {GI} penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations ({SWEs}). To make representer computations efficient, the {SWEs} are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order {SWE} system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized {GI} penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the {SWE}, with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University ({OSU}) Tidal Inversion Software ({OTIS}). {OTIS} includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of {TOPEX}/Poseidon altimeter data; for solution of the {GI} problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate {GI} solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. {OTIS} regional and local {GI} tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 105 nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of {OTIS} is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/6Â°) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},

	abstract  = {Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program. It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. It was developed by Thomas J. McCabe, Sr. in 1976.
Cyclomatic complexity is computed using the control flow graph of the program: the nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command. Cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual functions, modules, methods or classes within a program.
One testing strategy, called basis path testing by McCabe who first proposed it, is to test each linearly independent path through the program; in this case, the number of test cases will equal the cyclomatic complexity of the program.},

ADCIRC-2DDI is a two-dimensional, depth-integrated hydrodynamic model. ADCIRC-3DL is a three-dimensional model that couples the external mode solution generated by ADCIRC2DDI to a locally one-dimensional internal mode solution. The numerical internal mode solution can be obtained using either velocity or stress as the dependent variable. ADCIRC has been developed to simulate hydrodynamic circulation along shelves, coasts, and within estuaries. To allow long numerical simulations (on the order of a year) over very large computational domains (for example, the entire east coast of the United States), ADCIRC has been designed to have high computational efficiency and has been tested extensively for both hydrodynamic accuracy and numerical stability. The results of these tests are included in this report.},
