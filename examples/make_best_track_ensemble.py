"""
Script to extract an ATCF best track dataset and modify it 
e.g., Make it more intense or larger in size

Example for Sandy2012 and prescribed start and end dates 
that are valid. 
- central_pressure is decreased by 10%,
- max_sustained_wind_speed is increased by 10%
- radius_of_maximum_winds is increased by 10%
